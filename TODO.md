# Big features

[ ] Custom keybindings.
[ ] Mark file to peform actions.
[ ] Polish modules moving stuff like the config one.
[ ] Refactor the error popup to be able to contain also other stuff.

Command-line args:
[ ] '--temp' to make the session temporary (no changes made to bookmarks and other stuff).
[ ] '--emit-defaults' to emit the default configuration somewhere.
[ ] '--version' to emit the actual version.
[ ] '--help'

# Small features

All of this needs to work also on groups (marked files):
[ ] Create file.
[ ] Delete file with confirmation.
[ ] Move file.
[ ] Rename file.

Shell:
[ ] Command-line access to shell like vim.
[ ] Store the history of commands somewhere.

History:
[ ] Review the history of previously done commands.
[ ] Display the list of previously visited directories.

[ ] Go-to prompt to access another directory.
[ ] Display somewhere the active filter.
[ ] Filtering can be case sensitive or not based on the action required.

# Things to be fixed

[ ] Window configuration needs to be rethinked because now it's very messy.
[ ] Global modules need to be marked like @builtin so no prefixing is needed.
[ ] Filtering should be case-insensitive.

# Things to think of

[ ] Drop the bookmarks window in favor of a popup version.
[ ] SSH connection
